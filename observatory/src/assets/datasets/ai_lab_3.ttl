A group of today\u2019s airmen from No 2 Squadron from RAF Lossiemouth travelled from Scotland especially to be present and formed a standard party to pay tribute to their former colleague. The band of Northampton\u2019s Air Training Corps led the procession from the church and a young ATC bugler played the Last Post.\u00a0 The Bishop of Brixworth, the Right Reverend John Holbrook and the Rector of the Uplands Group of parishes, the Reverend Chris Peck, conducted a service of remembrance in St Andrew\u2019s Church, Spratton.\nThe proceedings were organised by Spratton Local History Society and supported by Northamptonshire County Council, Daventry District Council and the Daventry District Housing Community Chest.

When he left school he became a farm labourer, but after his family left Spratton he found work in the nearby ironstone quarries and lodged with his uncle and aunt, Robert and Elizabeth Balderson, in Station Road (now Brixworth Road). He met and married a Spratton girl, Susan Manning from Manor Road, in the summer of 1915. He joined up after his marriage - probably in 1916 when married men were conscripted.\nHe served in France in the British Expeditionary Force with the Suffolk Regiment and returned safely at the end of the war. He was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Richard died in Spratton on 15 March 1956 aged 69.\nRichard's son, born in December 1918, also called Richard, was killed in action with the Northamptonshire Regiment in the Second World War in December 1942 and is buried in the old cemetery in Spratton in a Commonwealth War Grave.\n"^^xsd:string .

He was born on 26 September 1887 and attended the village school for nine years. When he left school aged 13, he helped his father who was a shoemaker. In the next few years the family moved away from Spratton and Herbert went to board at the kennels at Brixworth where he worked as a groom for the Pytchley Hunt.\nHe volunteered to fight at the beginning of the war and was sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force for the spring offensive of 1915. He served with the 1st Battalion The Highland Light Infantry and was severely wounded in May 1915. He died of his wounds on 25 May 1915 aged 28 and is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves section of Ladywell Cemetery in Lewisham. He is remembered on the War Memorial in Spratton.\n"^^xsd:string .

The Austins were a long-established family in Spratton. When he was 13 Frank, a stable boy, was confirmed in St Luke's Church (now known as St Andrew's Church). Like his older brother William, he quickly volunteered for service when war was declared in 1914 and the following year was sent to the Western Front with the 2nd Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment. Aged only 18 years, he was wounded at the Battle of Auber's Ridge on 9 May 1915 when so many of his comrades were killed. He was wounded again on 26 October 1915 and was sent to a hospital at Sheerness.\nIn March 1916 he returned to France but was wounded for a third time at the Battle of St Eloi Craters, near Ypres. Again he was returned to England, but this time he stayed on home service (probably with the 3rd Battalion, Royal West Surrey Regiment) until he was demobbed in 1920. Frank was awarded the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. He died in Northampton in December 1975 aged 78.\n"^^xsd:string .

Early in October 1917 while home on leave he took his medal into the village primary school to show the schoolmaster, Mr Harry Smith. He returned to France and was killed later that same month in Houthuist Forest, near Ypres, in the second battle of Passchendaele. He has no known grave, but is remembered at the Tyne Cot cemetery near Ypres, where his name is engraved on Panel 72. He is also remembered on the Spratton War Memorial.\nHe holds the Military Medal, the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\n"^^xsd:string .

His father was a market gardener who later became the farm bailiff at Broomhill Farm and his mother was a Spratton-born girl whose family were long-established in the village. Young Charles has left written memories of his very happy childhood in the Northamptonshire countryside and his work on the farm with his father and brothers. He claims to have been very friendly with William Rhodes-Moorhouse, a young man who lived at Spratton Grange nearby and who went on to be awarded the first air Victoria Cross in April 1915.\nHis admiration for William Rhodes-Moorhouse may have led Charles to follow his example and join the Royal Flying Corps. However, he was extremely young and was not sent overseas. Possibly he became a driver. His name is on the Roll of Honour in St Andrew's Church Spratton, but very little other information has been discovered about his war service. After the war, he owned a garage in Yew Tree Lane and later moved to Warwickshire. He died in 1975.\nFor further information see\u00a0\u201cLt William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse VC, RFC\u2014A Northamptonshire Hero\u201d\r\nby Enid Jarvis\u00a0published by Spratton Local History Society\u00a0\n"^^xsd:string .

The family lived in Middle Turn (now Brixworth Road), Spratton. When he left school, Richard became an agricultural labourer and later a bricklayer's labourer. Both he and his brother William served in the First World War. Richard married Theodosia Manning in July 1902 and they lived in Bakers Lane, later moving to the Brixworth Road. They had seven children born between 1903 and 1918.\nHe volunteered in June 1915 but was not sent overseas, possibly because of his low medical category. He did his training at Blandford and was stationed at various depots including Lee-on-Solent and Purfleet. Having been transferred to the RAF Reserve in March 1919, he was finally discharged in April 1920. As he did not serve overseas, he was not entitled to the campaign medals.\n"^^xsd:string .

William's father died in 1903, so as a child William lived with his grandparents, Henry and Mary Ann Copson, and widowed mother in Erskine Cottages, Manor Road, Spratton. His mother worked for Lord Erskine at Spratton Hall. William was known as \"Nebby\" in the village. His surname is spelt as \"Cattle\" on the Roll of Honour in Spratton Church, but the family use \"Cattell\" on the gravestones.\nDespite his youth, William managed to enlist before the end of the First World War in the Norfolk Regiment. He was not sent overseas, but remained on Home Service. Because of this, he was not entitled to the campaign medals. His uncle, Henry Owman Copson, was killed in France in September 1917.\nWilliam married Harriet Wykes in April 1925 and they lived in Spratton for the rest of their lives. William died on 16 March 1974 aged 73 and is buried in the new parish cemetery in Spratton together with his wife, Harriet.\n"^^xsd:string .

In July 1913 he married Edith Dunkley, a Spratton girl from a long-established family in the village, and they lived for a time with her family at the Beer House in Spratton. Edith and Charles had three children, Alice, Edith and Francis. Charles worked first as a farm labourer but then moved to the nearby quarries as an ironstone labourer.\r\n\n\r\n\tHe volunteered in November 1915 aged 22 under Lord Derby's Scheme and was mobilized six months later, being posted to the 16th Royal Fusiliers. By August 1916 he was transferred to the Machine Gun Corps, and sent to Basrah and Suez working as a shoeing smith and becoming qualified in that trade. In 1918 he was sent to join the 3rd Lahore Division of the Machine Gun Corps with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In September 1918 he became sick with dysentery and was discharged as unfit for service soon after. However, he must have enjoyed service life because he applied to be transferred to the Reserves in January 1920. Charles was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. He died in Bedfordshire in March 1975 aged 81.\r\n\n"^^xsd:string .

George Dunkley came from a long-established family in the village. Frank had a younger sister, Edith born in 1895. The family lived in one of the Erskine Cottages on Manor Road. On leaving school, Frank followed his father into the shoe trade but by 1911, George was an under-gardener at Spratton Hall and Frank was one of nine staff working at Guilsborough Hall. He progressed from footman, to valet and finally to butler.\nFrank volunteered in the Northamptonshire Regiment on 20 April 1915 and was posted to France on 1 September 1915. He took part in some of the fiercest fighting in the war, notably the battles of Loos, the Somme, Arras, Vimy Ridge, Ypres, Passchendaele and Cambrai. He was gassed at Cambrai on 16 October 1918 and spent some months in hospital. He was finally discharged on 11 May 1919 and was awarded the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. He died in Bedfordshire in June 1962 aged 80.\n"^^xsd:string .

His mother, Kate, was born in New Zealand and was the cousin of Lieutenant Rhodes-Moorhouse VC RFC (born September 1887).* Henry and Kate were married in February 1887 in Lamport Church and the wedding was attended by Mr and Mrs Edward Moorhouse who were living at Lamport Hall at the time, but who later moved to Spratton Grange. However, Henry Elsdale died young and by the time Robinson was nine years old, his mother was a widow and living \"on her own means\" renting Holly House in Church Road, Spratton.\nRobinson made the army his career and when he was 19 he was an \"Army Student\" and part of the Regular Army. He became a Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers and was sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force in November 1914 where he was wounded. He also served on the staff of the British Forces in Italy. He was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nHaving been promoted to Captain, he retired from the Royal Engineers on 17 February 1925. It seems that he then joined the Royal Corps of Signals and worked in the USA with the rank of Colonel from 1942 to 1947. In 1947 he received an American award, the Legion of Merit, Degree of Officer, for his work in the USA. This award was gazetted in January 1947 as \"distinguished services in the cause of the Allies\".\nRobinson died in 1975, aged 83, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.\nSee also Lieutenant William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse VC RFC - A Northamptonshire Hero by Enid Jarvis published by Spratton Local History Society.\n"^^xsd:string .

His father Albert, who was born in Somerset, was a domestic gardener and the family moved about a great deal in search of work. Consequently the children of the marriage were born in a number of different places. When Sidney was 19 the family lived in Naseby where his father, Albert, worked as a gardener on a large estate. At some time between 1911 and 1918, Albert decided to retire from gardening and he became the landlord of The Chequers, a popular public house in Manor Road, Spratton. Three of the brothers served in the First World War - Sidney, Eric and Hugh.\nSidney was conscripted into the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1916, aged 24 and was sent overseas with the British Expeditionary Force. On 21 March 1918 the Germans broke through the allied lines and captured the village of Bullecourt, situated on the front line between Arras and Bapaume. On 24 March Sidney was taken prisoner. In December 1918 he was repatriated, arriving at Hull aboard SS Willochra. He arrived home in Spratton in January 1919 with three other returning prisoners of war. The vicar wrote in his Parish Newsletter: \"It is a great joy to welcome them back from captivity and suffering - We trust they will speedily regain their strength and be none the worse for the hardships they have endured\". Sidney was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nHe married Ethel Violet Addington in 1922 and died in Berkshire on 11 January 1961.\n"^^xsd:string .

Both the Greens and the Holts were long established families in Spratton. When he left school, Albert started working for his father as a blacksmith and this continued to be his main skill for many years. In 1895 he married Emma Buckle from Suffolk and he went into the business of buying corn and hay to support his growing family.\nThe couple went on to produce seven children. He was clearly a successful businessman because by the time he was 47 he owned a number of cottages in School Road and in Manor Road, was the licensee of The King's Head in Middle Turn, Spratton (now Brixworth Road) and also owned a large house in Station Road, called the Olde White Horse (a former coaching inn).\nAlbert was a prominent and influential man in the village. Not only was he the publican of the largest public house in Spratton from 1910 to 1914, he was also a member of Spratton Parish Council (Chairman 1905-7), superintendent of the Fire Brigade and the fund manager for the village street lighting (together with the highly respected schoolmaster, Harry Smith). He was a caring family man who provided employment for three nephews, his sister, Emily, his wife, Emma, and daughter, Florence. He had his share of sadness as two of his young children lie in the old parish cemetery in Spratton.\nAlbert had his 50th birthday in September 1914, so he was too old to enlist. Nevertheless he had already joined the Northamptonshire Yeomanry and was a Reservist as a master farrier. The Northamptonshire Yeomanry A Squadron had its headquarters in Northampton and a drill station at Cottesbrooke, so it is most likely he joined this group. The A Squadron came under the orders of 8th Division in October 1914 and was sent to France in November 1914. Albert arrived in France on 6 November 1914. Because of his age, experience and skills (as a blacksmith) he was put at the top of the non-commissioned officer ranks - Warrant Officer Class 2. He transferred to 346 Brigade, Royal Field Artillery on 31 January 1917, with the rank of Field Quartermaster Sergeant.\nAlbert served throughout the war and was finally discharged on 22 September 1919. He was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\n"^^xsd:string .

When he left school Benjamin followed his father's trade and became a shoemaker but when he married Isabel Keeber from Brixworth in 1908 he had become a farm labourer. The couple had two daughters and they lived in a small thatched cottage in First Turn (now Holdenby Road). His mother, Mrs Hannah Green, a widow, lived next door. These cottages were demolished in the 1950s.\nBenjamin joined the Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment, probably early in 1916. He fought in France and was in action at the Battle of the Somme. He was killed on 18 November 1916, but it was some time before his death was confirmed because he was reported as missing in the Northampton Mercury on 19 January 1917. He is buried in the Connaught Cemetery, Thiepval, France, and is remembered on the War Memorial in Spratton churchyard. He was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nHis widow, Isabel, later married Alwyn Wykes who had also served in the First World War.\n"^^xsd:string .

Frank was one of ten children. All five of the sons served in the First World war: Arthur, Frank, Harold, Jack and Walter, but sadly Walter was killed in action in 1915. The family moved around frequently in order for George to find work and the children were born in a number of different places. Frank spent his early years in Brixworth, but by the age of 14 he had left school and was working for Herbert Holt as a farm labourer at Naseby Grange. He later worked for Charlie Gilby, a Spratton farmer. His working life was spent doing mostly farm labouring. He was an expert hedge cutter and even entered hedge cutting competitions. However at one time he was involved in digging trenches and laying gas pipes, connecting gas to local villages.\nFrank joined the Royal Field Artillery in April 1917 aged 20. He was posted to India six months later on garrison duties as a driver in Quetta, Poona and Rawal Pindi. He also looked after horses. Horses were still the main method of pulling artillery around during WW1. He actually had a finger bitten off by a horse! He played football for the army and also had the misfortune to contract malaria which left him with recurring bouts in later years. He was discharged from the army in April 1919 and awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nOn 23 December 1916 he married Mary Eliza (Polly) Cook from Spratton. Frank was 20 and Polly 18 years old. They had two daughters - Priscilla Kathleen Anne (Kath), who married Tom Smith and died in 2002. Her son, Graham Smith still lives in the village. The other daughter was Nelly who had four sons: Leonard (Len), Derek, who lives in Norwich, Edward (Ted), George and Frank.\nThe couple lived in a cottage in Manor Road (brother Harold lodged with them for several years) and later in a council house in Smith Street. Frank died on 8 March 1978, aged 81 years. He is buried with his wife Polly in the new parish cemetery in Spratton.\n"^^xsd:string .

Harold was the youngest of ten children. All five of the sons served in the First World War: Arthur, Frank, Harold, Jack and Walter, but sadly Walter was killed in action in 1915. The family moved around frequently in order for George to find work and the children were born in a number of different places. By the time he was nine years old Harold's parents had moved to a four-roomed cottage in Haynes Lane, Spratton (no longer standing). Walter aged 16 and Harold were the only children still living at home.\nWhen war was declared Harold was only 14 years old. When the war ended he was only 18. Nevertheless, according to his son his father spent some time in India and was later sent to France where he was in an area of the trenches that was hit hardest. Harold lost all his hair at a very young age and was completely bald. It must have been very stressful for so young a man to endure the horrors of warfare. We have been unable to find Harold's war records, but we know that he was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nHarold was very close to his brother Frank and after the war he lived with his brother's family in Manor Road until he married Betsy Cattell, a nurse, in 1939. Harold worked as a general labourer and a farm labourer and was involved with the building of Ravensthorpe Reservoir. Sandhills council houses were built in 1952 which is where Adge and Betsy lived for the rest of their lives. Betsy was well known for brewing homemade wine! She died in September 1967 and Adge followed three years later on 26 June 1970 aged 69 years. They are in separate graves in the new parish cemetery in Spratton.\n"^^xsd:string .

Jack was one of ten children. All five of the sons served in the First World War: Arthur, Frank, Harold, Jack and Walter, but sadly Walter was killed in action in 1915. The family moved around frequently in order for George to find work and the children were born in a number of different places. Jack spent his early years in Brixworth but he was already a professional soldier and living away from home by the time he was 21.\nSince he was in the Regular army (he enlisted in January 1908), he was called on to fight as soon as war was declared. He was sent to France with the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards early in October 1914 and two weeks later he had distinguished himself in action at Ypres. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal \"for great gallantry on 16 October, 1914, at Ypres, when he performed invaluable work and showed conspicuous courage in carrying messages, enabling some Companies on one occasion to get out of a difficult position\".\nJack was severely wounded in a shell attack when all the men around him were killed. He was reported missing soon after. He was not dead, however, but had been taken prisoner by the enemy forces. He was sent to a Prisoner of War camp in Hannover in January 1915 and at the end of March he was moved to the camp at Aachen where there were a number of hospitals for British prisoners. He apparently underwent 53 operations and at some stage had his left leg amputated. The Northampton Independent dated 12 July 1915, mentions that Jack was a Prisoner of War in Germany, receiving parcels from the Independent.\nOn 6 January 1917 while still in the army, Corporal Jack Hayter married Ethel Downes in the bride's parish church of St Luke's, Chelsea. The bridegroom gave his address as Roehampton, Surrey. The bride's father had been in the army and was an army pensioner. Because of the wounds he had received, Jack was discharged from the army as medically unfit one month later. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the 1914 Star with Clasp as well as the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

All five of the sons served in the First World War: Arthur, Frank, Harold, Jack and Walter, but sadly Walter was killed in action in 1915. The family moved around frequently in order for George to find work and the children were born in a number of different places. By the time Walter was 16 the family lived in Haynes Lane, Spratton in a four-roomed cottage that has since been demolished and he was working as a general labourer.\nWhen war was declared in 1914 Walter was employed by Messrs Green, contractors of Northampton, working at Cottesbrooke Hall (where his father was employed as a gardener) but he enlisted in the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment in the October. He was sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force in November 1914 and was killed in action on 3 July 1915. He was 21 years old. His obituary appeared a few days later in The Northampton Independent. He is buried at the Quarry Cemetery, Vermelles, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, northern France and is remembered on the War Memorial in Spratton churchyard.\nWalter's mother, Priscilla, never recovered from the death of her son. She died the following year and a memorial to Walter is on her tombstone, which is in the old cemetery in Brixworth Road, Spratton. It reads: Also Walter Hayter, son of the above, who was killed in action in France July 3 1915 aged 21 years. \"Greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends.\" \"Onward Christian Soldiers\"\nHis medals, awarded posthumously, include the1914 Star and Clasp, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Of five brothers who went to war he was the only one who did not return.\n"^^xsd:string .

At some point after 1911 Horace became the police constable for Spratton and he moved to the village with his family.\nHe was sent to France on 13 February 1915 aged 29, as a bombardier with the Royal Garrison Artillery and rose through the ranks until he reached Regimental Sergeant Major, the most senior of the non-commissioned ranks. He served with the 121st Heavy Brigade of the Royal Garrison Artillery fighting with heavy guns (usually 60 pounders) sending large calibre high explosive shells to destroy the enemy\u2019s artillery. He was awarded the 1915 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nHorace returned to Northamptonshire after the war, living in Byfield. He died in the Radcliffe Infirmary Oxford on 26 August 1960 aged 74.\n"^^xsd:string .

They lived in one of a group of small cottages on the corner of Manor Road and Middle Turn (now Brixworth Road). Reginald was brought up with his four sisters and they all attended the village primary school. When Reginald left school in 1907 he became a farm labourer, but volunteered for the army when war was declared in August 1914. His father died at about the same time and his mother left Spratton and moved into Northampton.\nReginald served in the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment and was sent overseas on 29 April 1915 just as fighting on the Western Front near Ypres was becoming more intense. The enemy had greatly strengthened their defences with thick barbed wire, concrete blockhouses and machine gun emplacements, and poison gas was being used for the first time.\u00a0 The British Expeditionary Force could not break through and the Northamptonshire Regiment suffered terrible losses at the Battle of Auber\u2019s Ridge on 9 May 1915.\u00a0 Reginald, aged 21 years, was killed at Auber\u2019s Ridge. He had been fighting for only one week. He has no known grave but his name is on Le Touret Memorial (on the Bethune to Armentieres Road) in France and also on the War Memorial in Spratton churchyard.\u00a0 He was awarded the 1915 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\n"^^xsd:string .

Five brothers in Joseph and Elizabeth\u2019s family served in the First World War \u2013 Harry, Joseph, George, William and Walter. In 1901 the family was living at Calendar Farm, Cottesbrooke and on leaving school William became a groom at Cottesbrooke Hall.\u00a0 On 28 December 1910 aged 18 he joined the Royal Irish Lancers, known as the Lancers of the Line.\u00a0 He was in the cavalry and spent time in Ireland before war was declared in August 1914 when he was posted immediately to France\nHe enjoyed life in the army and was promoted to Corporal in 1915 and then to Sergeant in April 1916. He took part in all the major battles the 5th Lancers were engaged in and was wounded at Ypres in 1915 and on the Somme in 1916.\nOn 31 January 1917, whilst home on leave, he married Mary Byrne at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Westminster.\u00a0 Later that year, when he returned to the Front his bravery earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal:\n8 July 1917 Citation 3161 London Gazette:\u00a0 Conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in rallying the remnants of his troop and encouraging them to continue fighting.\u00a0 When ordered to retire, he remained to the last, and was for some time alone in the trench with the enemy but succeeded in getting away after covering the retirement of his men.\nIn March 1918 he was seriously wounded in the leg. A bullet through the thigh severed his sciatic nerve so that he had no use in his foot.\u00a0 He was captured by the Germans on 26 March 1918 and was sent to Prison of War camps in Clogny, Guise and Laugensaiza in Saxony.\u00a0 He wrote an interesting account of the treatment he received as a prisoner.\u00a0 He was repatriated to hospital in England on 24 October 1918 but never fully recovered from his injuries.\u00a0 He was discharged as permanently unfit on 20 January 1920.

George attended Spratton primary school and when the family moved from the village he briefly became a boot and shoe worker in Northampton. He enlisted in the army in 1902 aged 16, and in 1911 when he was 25 he was living in army barracks in Hampshire.\u00a0 He was a flag sergeant and instructor of signallers in 1914.\u00a0 A fine athlete, he won numerous awards in the army for sports and shooting achievements. Four of the Reeve brothers served in the First World War \u2013 George, Richard (known as Harry), Samuel and Sidney.\u00a0 Three brothers sadly died; Harry was the only one to survive.\nGeorge had a distinguished career in the army and there is no shortage of information about him. As a regular soldier, he was sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force in August 1914 as soon as war was declared.\u00a0 He served with great distinction throughout, fighting at Mons in 1914 as well as the battles of the Marne, the Aisne, La Bassee, Ypres, Neuve Chapelle , Festubert, Loos, the Somme, Arras and Cambrai right through to early 1918.\u00a0 He was wounded in action at least four times, commissioned in the field for gallantry and won both the Military Medal and the Military Cross.\u00a0 George was promoted from Sergeant to acting Regimental Sergeant Major on 19 April 1915 and by November of that year he had been commissioned as a Second Lieutenant.\u00a0 He was mentioned in Sir John French\u2019s New Year despatches on 1 January 1916 and promoted to full Lieutenant on 5 February 1918.\nIn the early summer of 1915 George was on patrol duty near Hill 60, south of Ypres, when he was wounded in the head by a hand grenade. He was awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and good service at the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915 and also received his commission.\nHe was wounded again on 18 January 1916 while raiding enemy trenches near Beaumont Hamel in the Somme area. He and another injured officer were dragged to safety by an orderly under constant heavy fire. (The orderly was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.) George was treated in the Red Cross hospital at Rouen and then sent home to England. He was back at the front line again later in the year and took over command of C Company, Royal Irish Fusiliers. He was wounded fighting around Guillemont and Ginchy during the final stages of the battle of the Somme on 12 October 1916. He was treated in the military hospital at Etaples for a leg wound and shell shock and then transferred to England for further treatment.\nOn 3 May 1917 his Company was held up on the Roeux-Gravrelle Road by heavy machine gun fire from the south and the north and there were many casualties. His men were mixed up with men of other battalions. George, despite being wounded, collected together all the Irish Fusiliers, reorganised them, and dug in on a line from west of the Chateau to the railway embankment where he established himself and remained until recalled by order some hours later. He was successful in withdrawing with few casualties and bringing his wounded with him.\u00a0 His gallantry and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of the Military Cross and he returned to London where he was presented with his medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace.\u00a0 Back in Northampton he was feted by Northampton Castle Ward Conservative Association, and the newspapers made much of him. In the midst of the celebrations he found time to return to Spratton to take his medals to show the Schoolmaster, Mr Harry Smith, and no doubt all the children at the school.\u00a0(See the extract from the school log book below, in which Harry Smith is incorrect in stating that George had won the DCM; he had already been awarded the Military Medal.)\nThe citation for the Military Cross, published in the London Gazette on 18 July 1917, reads:\n\u201cFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.\u00a0 He showed great resource and determination in assuming command of his company when all other\u00a0\u00a0 officers were casualties, in reorganising men of other companies, in digging in and maintaining his position. He subsequently withdrew and brought all his wounded with him.\u00a0 His skill was most marked.\u201d\nLate in 1918, George was sent back to England and attached to the 52nd Battalion, King\u2019s Royal Rifle Corps at Colchester, Essex. Very sadly he was killed in a road accident on 14 October 1918 aged 32.\u00a0 He was walking from the Barracks towards Colchester when he was hit by a taxi.\u00a0 He suffered a fractured skull and died the following morning in hospital.\u00a0 He is buried in a Commonwealth War Grave in Towcester Road Cemetery, Northampton.\u00a0 As well as being awarded the Military Cross and the Military Medal, George was entitled to the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nFurther information on Lieutenant George Reeve MC MM can be found in \u2018Researching British Military Medals\u2019 by Steve Dymond, published by The Crowood Press 1999\nand \n\u2018Stories Behind the Headstones\u2019 edited by Anne Garraway, published by Chase Park Publishing for Northampton University of the Third Age 2014\n"^^xsd:string .

There were four children \u2013 William and his sisters Anne and Mary and their brother Edward. The family moved to Northamptonshire in 1887, living first at Lamport Hall and moving to Spratton Grange in 1899. William was a pioneer in flying both in Northamptonshire and nationally and was regularly seen in the skies of the county in his Bleriot XI type monoplane. In 1912 he added Rhodes to his surname to comply with the terms of his grandfather\u2019s will.\nHe volunteered immediately war was declared and joined the Royal Flying Corps in August 1914.\u00a0 He was first sent to Farnborough Naval Air Station workshops and was in charge of inspecting engines for the RFC aeroplanes. In March 1915 he joined No 2 Squadron at\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Merville in northern France and began work as a reconnaissance pilot flying BE2 bi-planes.\nOn 26 April 1915 he was sent on a dangerous mission that was to earn him the Victoria Cross. The citation reads:\n\u00a0\u201c\u2026.for most conspicuous bravery in flying to Courtrai and dropping bombs on the railway line near that station.\u00a0 On starting the return journey he was mortally wounded, but succeeded in flying for 35 miles to his destination, at very low altitude, and reported the successful accomplishment of his object.\u00a0 He has since died of his wounds.\u00a0 This officer was flying a BE2b.\u201d\nWilliam Rhodes-Moorhouse was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross and promoted to Lieutenant (backdated to 24th April 1915). He was also awarded the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\u00a0 His body was returned to England and buried in Parnham in Dorset. He is remembered in Spratton with a commemorative stone in the centre of the village and on the Spratton War Memorial. He is also remembered on the War Memorials at Lamport, Northamptonshire, and Beaminster, Dorset. Beaminster also has a commemorative stone. His name is at the head of a list of air VCs in the RAF church of St Clement Dane in London. His medals, including the Victoria Cross, are on display in the Imperial War Museum, London.\u00a0\nSee also \u2018Lieutenant William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse VC RFC \u2013 A Northamptonshire Hero\u2019 by Enid Jarvis published by Spratton Local History Society.\n"^^xsd:string .

John (often known as William) appears to have started work as a shoemaker but then became a gardener.\u00a0 Like his father, he was part of the local Fire Brigade and the Spratton Brass Band. On 9 October1907 John married Elizabeth Austin from Spratton and they moved to a cottage further along Yew Tree Lane (where the Scout Hut now stands) and had two children, George and Frank. Sadly, George died of diphtheria in December 1916 aged 8.\nIn October 1914, aged 34, John joined the Northamptonshire Regiment Reserve and then in 1916 was transferred to the Royal Defence Corps, serving in England rather than abroad.\u00a0 He was working at the Eastcote Prisoner of War camp at the time of his son\u2019s death in 1916.\nIn 1918 he conducted the Spratton Brass Band for the village Peace celebrations and was church organist for about 36 years.

After leaving school, Abraham became an ironstone labourer, working for the Brixworth Ironstone Co Ltd.\u00a0 By 1911 he was living in Northampton and on 26 March 1912 he married May Richards in Northampton.\u00a0 A son, Sidney Samuel, was born on 19 June of that year.\u00a0 By the time their second son, John Bert, was born on 2 October 1913 they had moved back to Spratton.\nOn 15 June 1908 aged 17 Abraham joined the Special Reserve of the Northamptonshire Regiment and undertook regular training over the next few years. In 1913 he was re-engaged for a further six years and appointed Lance Corporal. In August 1914 he and his brother John William were mobilised and allocated to the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment. They were sent to France and while waiting to start active service Abraham was demoted back to Private. He and his brother were involved in a number of actions, including the 1st Battle of Ypres. He received serious gunshot wounds to his legs on 2 November 1914, the same day that his brother was killed, when there was heavy shelling of the trenches. He was treated at the military hospital at Rouen before being invalided back to England. He spent some time in hospital in Manchester before being posted back to France in March 1916.\u00a0 He proved to be still unfit and never returned to active service. He was transferred to the Labour Corps on 30 June 1917 but continued to be unfit and he returned to England for munitions work. He was applied for by his former employer, the Brixworth Ironstone Co Ltd, and he began work as an ironstone labourer on 8 January 1918. He was transferred to the Reserve and finally discharged in February 1919.\nAbraham was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\u00a0 He died in Northampton in June 1952 aged 61.\n"^^xsd:string .

John William became a farm labourer but also, in 1910 aged 17, he joined the 3rd Special Reserve Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment and underwent regular training while still working on the farm.\nIn August 1914 at the outbreak of the war, he and his brother Abraham were mobilised and posted to France with the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment.\u00a0 They saw their first major action near Pilkhem in October 1914 and then moved on to take part in the fighting closer to Ypres. John William was killed in action on 2 November 1914 in heavy shelling of the trenches near Ypres and his brother was wounded later that same night.\u00a0 When the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment were pulled out of the front line two weeks later, only five officers and 350 soldiers returned out of a battalion strength of over 900 men. John\u2019s widowed mother heard unofficially that he had been killed and she asked Miss Mildred Bevan of Spratton House to enquire at the War Office on her behalf.\u00a0 There was no official confirmation of John\u2019s death until 25 May 1915. He was 21 years of age.\nJohn William was awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal and his death is recorded on the Menin Gate at Ypres and on the Spratton War Memorial.\u00a0 He was one of the first Spratton men to be killed in the war.\n"^^xsd:string .

At the enlistment his medical classification was B2. He was discharged on 22 March 1919 and was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nIn his son John\u2019s memoirs he said that he remembered that his father had fought in France, but he refused to talk about his dreadful experiences afterwards. He remembered that his mother worked for Mr and Mrs Moorhouse at Spratton Grange and his father did some\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gardening work there as well.\u00a0 He used to mow a piece of very flat ground near to the Grange that William Rhodes-Moorhouse used as a landing strip for his early flying machines. Arthur died in Spratton in the autumn of 1957.\u00a0\n*John Henry Tarrant\u2019s memories are recorded in \u2018Memories of Old Spratton\u2019 by Enid Jarvis and Michael Heaton, 2007,\u00a0Spratton Local History Society.\n"^^xsd:string .

He worked as a farm labourer and also as a market gardener. Both Alwyn and his brother Jack served in the First World War. It was unusual at that time, that Alwyn and his brother both signed their Attestation papers with a cross, rather than signing their own name.\nAlwyn joined the 5th Bedfordshire Regiment Reserve on 16 February 1916 and was mobilised on 1 May 1917. He was posted to France and served as a stretcher bearer. The following year he was reported missing on 28 April 1918, but was found injured three days later. He was discharged on 12 March 1919 and awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nIn April 1920 he married Isabel Florence Green (n\u00e9e Keeber) and a daughter Rita Lucy was born in 1921. Isabel was the widow of Benjamin Green of First Turn, Spratton, who had been killed in action in France in 1916.\nAlwyn died in Northampton on 12 December1951, aged 66, and is buried in the new Parish Cemetery in Spratton with his wife, Isabel.\n"^^xsd:string .

The family lived in a cottage in Manor Road and three of the sons, John Francis, William and Walter, all served in the First World War. Walter was a farm labourer working at Broomhill Farm for Sir Mervyn Manningham-Buller.\nWhen he was 20 he joined the Northamptonshire Regiment Special Reserve (June 1908) and as soon as war was declared he joined the Northamptonshire Regiment. He served in the Military Police with the rank of Corporal at the beginning of the war, but this was not a success and when he was sent overseas in October 1916 he was transferred to the Royal Berkshire Regiment as a Private.\nHe suffered a gunshot wound to his hand in February 1917 and was treated in France at Rouen Hospital. Having been sent home for hospital treatment in Birmingham where one of his fingers was amputated, it was decided he was no longer fit for front-line duty and in December 1917 he was transferred to the Agricultural Unit of the Labour Corps. He worked on farms in this country until he was demobbed in May 1919. (Walter\u2019s discharge documents were addressed to him at \u2018Near the Hall, Spratton\u2019. Later papers were sent to him at \u2018Near the Hole, Spratton\u2019.) He received financial compensation for his injuries and was awarded the 1915 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nAfter the war, Walter and his wife Winifred lived in Brixworth Road, Spratton, and he served in the Home Guard in the Second World War.\u00a0 He died on 2 March 1959 aged 71 and is buried in the new parish cemetery in Spratton, as is his wife.\u00a0\n"^^xsd:string .

:078c0500-10a6-4b0d-bd7f-785f587ea91c tanc:text "\nRESEARCH ON THE SPRATTON MEN\nSources for research\n133 men from Spratton are named on the Roll of Honour in Spratton Church. The collection of names for this Roll was mentioned by the Vicar of Spratton, the Reverend George Raw, in his Newsletter as early as 1915 and the final document was presented to the Church by Miss Bevan of Spratton House in July 1920. The Roll gives the name of each man, his regiment and the theatre of war in which he served. Names given are often the name by which the man was generally known rather than the actual name on his birth certificate.\nPresent day research has found a further 35 men who were born in Spratton or who lived here for some considerable time and who served in the First World War. Sources for these extra names are: the Vicar's monthly Newsletters 1914-19, Absent Voters' List 1918, school log books, census returns, relatives.\nIt has been difficult to find those men who moved to the village after 1911 if they are not in any of the records listed above. We must wait for the 1921 census. We should be pleased to have information about any man we have missed. Please contact information@sprattonhistory.org\nWho were the men from Spratton who served in the First World War?\nThe men from Spratton who served in the army, navy and the newly formed air force were aged between 18 and 50 years and came from all walks of life. However, we have found a number who tried to enlist before they were 18 years e.g. John Higgs. 48% were from long established families in the village such as the Martin, Buckby, Horne, Taylor and Wykes families. Other families with three or more generations in the village were: Adnitt, Archer, Austin, Balderson, Copson, Gammage, Manning, Norman, Page and Smith.\nThe majority of men who served (52%), however, were newcomers who mostly came to Spratton seeking employment in the nearby ironstone quarries, on local farms, in the building trade or in service at the large houses in the village. A number of these men married girls from Spratton and stayed here for the rest of their lives.\nMost newcomers (35 men) were employed in domestic service as gardeners, grooms, footmen, butlers and chauffeurs. These men and their families travelled around from one large house to another, often for promotion - e.g. from footman to butler, or from under-gardener to head gardener. In Spratton they found work at:\n\nSpratton Hall - Lord Erskine\nBroomhill - Sir Mervyn Manningham-Buller\nSpratton Grange - Mr Edward Moorhouse\nSpratton House - Miss Bevan\n\nOccupations of men from Spratton who served in the First World War\n\nSkilled workers (33.33%, 46 men) including blacksmiths, bootmakers, bakers, carpenters, butchers, grocers and publicans.\nLabourers (33.33%, 46 men) including farm workers, ironstone quarry workers and bricklayers.\nDomestic servants (25.36%, 35 men) including gardeners, grooms, footmen, butlers and chauffeurs.\nIndependent means (4.34%, 6 men)\nProfessional (3.62%, 5 men) including clerks, a trainee teacher, an M.P. and a policeman\nWhen did the men of Spratton join up?\n\n\n\n1914\n42\nVolunteers aged 18 - 38 years joined the Regular Army for 3 years or the duration of the war\r\n\t\t\t18 years olds were not sent overseas\n\n\n1915\n56\nLord Derby's Scheme - 16 October to 15 December 1915.\r\n\t\t\tMen aged 18 - 40 years encouraged to enlist now, and be called up later\n\n\n1916\n30\n2 March - Conscription of unmarried men and widowers aged 19 - 41\r\n\t\t\t25 May - Conscription of married men 18 - 41 NB.

Some were already in the Regular Army, and some were in the Reserves. Others volunteered and some waited until conscription in March 1916. Some teenagers were so keen to serve that they tried to sign up before they were 18. At the moment, we have no information about men in reserved occupations nor about any who applied for deferment to a Military Tribunal (work in progress).\nWe know that 12 Spratton men had chosen the Regular Army as a career and were already serving when war was declared. Also, one teenager (Baden Gammage) was a boy entrant to the Duke of Edinburgh's Wiltshire Regiment. The Spratton \"Regulars\" had served in India, Egypt, the North-West Frontier, Malta, South Africa, Ireland and France. They were the first to be mobilised when war was declared in August 1914 and most were sent overseas with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).\n\nAlbert Baldwin, Royal Field Artillery\nA J Brown, Northamptonshire Regiment\nThomas Buckby MM, Royal Engineers\nWilliam G Buckby, Northamptonshire Regiment\nSir Mervyn Manningham-Buller, Rifle Brigade\nRobinson Elsdale, Royal Engineers\nBaden Gammage, Duke of Edinburgh's Wiltshire Regiment (died 1917 in Wiltshire)\nJohn C (Jack) Hayter DCM, Grenadier Guards\nHarry Hider, Northamptonshire Regiment\nJohn Leeson, Royal Field Artillery (died in action 1918)\nGeorge Martin, Royal Field Artillery (died of fever in India 1917)\nWilliam H Martin DCM, Royal Irish Lancers\nGeorge Reeve MC, MM, Royal Irish Fusiliers (died in 1918)\n\n\r\nOther Spratton men (15) had served in the Regular Army and at the end of their term of service they signed on in the \"Reserves\".

It did not matter whether they entered a theatre of war or not. All men who served in the main theatres of war qualified for this medal, as did those who left their native shore for service in, for example, India.\nVictory Medal 1914-1919\nIssued to all those who entered a theatre of war. It follows that every recipient of the Victory Medal also qualified for the British War Medal, but not the other way round.

From the Domesday Book we see three French nobles had been granted land in Spratone. Over the centuries a number of families held farms but much of the land was worked communally as open fields until the Enclosures. The Church was in the hands of the Abbey of St. James until Henry VIII\u2019s Act of Supremacy, 1534.\nAs a farming community the village was affected by all the vicissitudes of the agricultural economy right up until the First World War. In Victorian times cottage industries of Lacemaking and outworking for Shoemaking flourished. The main occupations of wage earners 1777-1901 were recorded:\n\n\nOccupation\n1777\n1841\n1881\n1901\n\n\n\n%\n%\n%\n%\n\n\nAgriculture\n20.8\n46.2\n37.8\n23.5\n\n\nTextiles\n32.8\n4.8\n0.9\n0.6\n\n\nShoemaking\n3.0\n8.0\n8.4\n12.7\n\n\nDomestic Servants\n8.9\n16.2\n20.3\n28.7\n\n\nCraftsmen\n11.9\n10.0\n11.6\n6.0\n\n\nShopkeepers\n10.4\n7.7\n8.4\n13.6\n\n\nGeneral Labourers\n8.9\n2.4\n11.3\n10.7\n\n\nProfessional\n3.0\n4.4\n2.5\n4.0\n\n\nAll this and much, much more is described in our book \"SPRATTON, A VILLAGE HISTORY\" \nEscorted walking tours of the village for groups can be arranged by appointment.\n"^^xsd:string .

Two of their sons, John (born 1633/34) and Lawrence (born 1635), emigrated to Virginia in 1657 with a number of others from Northamptonshire.\u00a0 The brothers prospered and in 1674 Lieutenant Colonel John Washington, with his partner and distant relative Colonel Nicholas Spencer, bought 5,000 acres of wilderness at the confluence of Little Hunting Creek and the Potomac River.\nJohn\u2019s land was later renamed Mount Vernon and in due course passed to his great grandson, George Washington.\u00a0 In 1776 George Washington became the first president of the newly independent United States.\nAn embroidery stitched by Amphillis in about 1640 is on display at Sulgrave Manor, on whose website can be seen the family tree.\u00a0 A letter written by her to her brother-in-law William Roades is preserved in the Verney Archive at Claydon House, Bucks.\u00a0 It was written in about 1650 shows that she was well educated and literate.\u00a0 She died on 12th January 1655 and was buried at Tring.\n"^^xsd:string .

It may originally have been dedicated to St Andrew but, during the 18th and 19th centuries, it was dedicated to St Luke.\u00a0 The dedication reverted to St Andrew in 1949.\nThe church, built from ironstone, stands on high ground in the centre of the village and has a tower with a spire.\u00a0 The original building probably dated from Saxon times but was enlarged and strengthened in 1120 in the days of Henry I and parts of the old church still survive.\u00a0 The bell tower was built in about 1195 AD and a north aisle added.\u00a0 The first recorded vicar was Henry de Briggstok, inducted in December 1274, as shown in the list of vicars.\nOne of the treasures of St Andrew\u2019s Church is the tomb of Sir John Swinford who died in 1371 and whose story is told on a separate page of this site. The south aisle was added in the 14th century and the chancel was added in the early 16th century.\u00a0 In 1505 John Chambers, a descendant of John Swinford, built a chantry chapel on the north side of the chancel.\u00a0 The plain stone font situated by the south door is thought to be 13th century or older.\nThe five old bells were originally cast in 1685 and hung in a wooden frame.\u00a0 In 1929 it was decided that no.2 and no.4 bells needed to be recast and the bells rehung in a steel frame.\u00a0 \u00a3385 was raised for the renovation and they rang out once more from April 1930.\u00a0 At that time, space was left for a sixth bell and in 1988 a new treble bell weighing five and a quarter hundredweight (266.7kg) was installed.\nThe interior of the church was restored in 1847 by Sir George Gilbert Scott with the builder Cooper of Derby.\u00a0 The choir stalls with carved finials were restored and the north porch rebuilt. In 1870 the spire then had to be taken down nearly to the base and rebuilt.\u00a0 Further renovation to the spire was required after two terrible storms and a lightning strike in 1946.\nSpratton villagers have been buried in the churchyard for nearly 800 years and thousands lie beneath the grass.\u00a0 Today, only 215 graves are marked, mainly from the 18th and 19th centuries.\u00a0 The grandest tomb, near the north porch, belongs to the Lantsbery family.\u00a0 The churchyard was closed for burials in 1903.\n"^^xsd:string .

1821, and his wife Alice, 1761 - 1831, were members of the Creaton Independent Chapel and their first four children were baptised there between 1799 and 1805.\u00a0 In 1806 enough subscriptions were raised and collected among the congregation and friends of Creaton Chapel by Joseph Whitehead for the Spratton Independent Chapel to be built.\nAlice (nee Bunting), William's wife, recorded the opening of the chapel in a bible, probably given to the chapel by her father: \"Began to build this meeting in our orchard June 27th 1806 and it was built by subscription and collected by Mr. Whitehead.\u00a0\u00a0 My dear Mr William Lantsbery gave the ground and stone to build the East side and boarded the men whilst in building it.\u00a0\u00a0 Opened it the day I was 30 years old September 27th 1806\".\nOn 4th October 1806, Joseph Whitehead, William Lantsbery and Thomas Knight recorded the following deed: \"We the undersigned being Protestant Dissenters from the Church of England do hereby certify that a certain building, newly erected in a piece of ground belonging to Mr Wm Lantsbery, situate in the Parish of Spratton, and County of Northampton, is intended for a place of Worship, for Protestant Dissenters to meet in, according to the Statute of King William and Queen Mary, commonly called the Toleration Act - Witness our Hands this 4th day of October 1806\".\nThe Creaton Chapel and its daughter chapel at Spratton were independent and would therefore have answered a non-conformist need without a denominational label.\nIn 1821 William Lantsbery died.\u00a0 Ownership of the land upon which the chapel was built passed to his son Samuel who later sold it to his brother William, perhaps when he emigrated to America in 1849.\u00a0 It would seem that at no time was a formal trust set up for this plot but that the land was gifted by William Lantsbery in 1806, and that this was recognized down to the death of his son, William Lantsbery, in January 1884.\nIt seems that from the 1840s, when the Spratton Baptist Chapel was formed, use of the Spratton Independent Chapel waned with several of the parishioners switching their allegiance.\u00a0 Between 1886 and 1892 the Salvation Army rented it for 5/- per month, but Creaton reserved the right to hold their monthly service.\u00a0 Then in 1893 it was decided to sell the chapel.\u00a0 Ownership of Kites Hall had passed from the Lantsberys to a Mr Gulliver, who bought the chapel for \u00a340.\nPostscript: \u00a0it was in the 1890s that Kites Hall was occupied by the Reverend Humphrey G Roberts, the curate of Spratton and later its vicar, who changed the name to the Manor House.\nThe Baptist Chapel\nThe Baptist Chapel on the Brixworth road was licensed as a place of worship in 1843.\u00a0 \u00a3140 was paid for the building to be used in Trust as a Chapel and Meeting House and ten Trustees appointed.\nIt was to be \u201ca place of public religious worship for the service of God by Protestant Dissenters called the Independent and Particular Baptists\u201d.\u00a0 Thomas Warner was the first minister.\u00a0 Another was James Roach who died in 1893 aged 42.\u00a0 He was buried in the churchyard of the Parish Church opposite the chapel.\nThe chapel was not licensed for weddings but an exception was made in July 1966 when David Billingham and Jillian Green wished to marry.\u00a0 The signatures of all the members had to be obtained in order for permission to be granted.\n\u00a0\n"^^xsd:string .

She worked as a governess to earn some money and then in 1895 went to St Hughes College, Oxford where she achieved First Class marks but, as a woman, was not allowed to graduate. She then taught at schools in Edgbaston and Worthing before attending the University of London where in 1898 she was finally able to graduate with a First Class degree in English.\u00a0\nEmily became a Governess with a family in Berkshire before moving to Spratton Grange, Spratton in about 1900 to teach Mary and Anne Moorhouse, the sisters of William Rhodes-Moorhouse.\u00a0 It is unclear how many years she taught the girls but was certainly living there on the night of the 1901 Census.\u00a0 A photograph in Mary and Anne\u2019s album has the caption \u201cPoor dear EWD was our governess about 1900 till I went to Queen\u2019s Gate.\u00a0 She was a brilliant teacher, a good woman, but rather unbalanced and strange.\u201d\nIn 1906 Emily joined the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union, founded by Emmeline Pankhurst,\u00a0 and quickly became involved in demonstrations in support of women\u2019s suffrage.\u00a0 By 1908 she had given up teaching and was completely dedicated to the movement. In 1909 she received the first of nine prison sentences.\u00a0 She went on many hunger strikes and was force fed on a number of occasions.\nFinally, on 4th June 1913, she ran on to the racetrack at the Epsom Derby in the path of King George V\u2019s horse.\u00a0 She was badly injured and died in hospital on 8th June 2013.\u00a0 Modern historians generally agree that she was aiming to draw attention to the Suffragettes\u2019 cause rather than wanting to commit suicide.\n"^^xsd:string .

While we do not know the numbers employed before the 1840 census, even at that date 43% of the trades shown were involved in farming. Villages like Spratton would have been self-sufficient communities, so other trades complemented the staple agricultural activity.\nThere are thirteen still-existing stone-built dwellings which can be identified as the core of the farming of Spratton\u2019s 2100 acres, with small-holdings interspersed amongst these. Up until 1766, almost all the acreage was farmed in open fields with strips allocated to individuals to grow crops or keep livestock, a process controlled by the manorial court.\nThe countryside would have looked very different without the hedgerows which we take for granted. Then in 1766, enclosure took place allowing owners to have a distinct and often considerable land-holding and hedges were introduced to enclose these holdings and to divide fields into manageable sizes. Over the years the multiplicity of owners has steadily reduced so that there are now five main holdings which control about 70% of Spratton\u2019s mixed arable and livestock farming. Today a considerable acreage is also given over to the keeping of horses.\n"^^xsd:string .

:de1d0326-c3a5-4eff-bc75-06ea9690c0de tanc:text "\nHOUSES OF THE VILLAGE\nThe earliest surviving houses in the village are the stone built farmhouses from the 17th century. Two of these are believed to be from around 1650, one in Manor Road opposite the church and one in Yew Tree Lane.\nBefore the advent of the turnpike road (now A5199), the thoroughfare from Northampton to Leicester came in from the south up Entry Hill into Yew Tree Lane crossing Brixworth Road (which was a mere narrow track) into School and Manor Roads, before going up the ancient hollow way to Little Creaton. With the house in Manor Road the only exception, all the main dwellings were built along this axis, which has 6 or 7\u00a0 17c houses still standing and mostly constructed in the last decade of that century. At the time, these were all two storey and thatched. Workers cottages were intermingled along this axis.\nA hundred years later a few wealthy land-owners wanted to upgrade and this was the start of larger and often three-storey dwellings, with good examples in Church Road. Some of the two-storey farmhouses were extended upwards at this time or later. (If known the oldest record of number of dwellings).\nExpansion of the village started in the 1930s with Smith Street and Holdenby Road, but more so from the 1960s to 1980s with the village being in-filled between its original core and the A5199. There are now some 530 dwellings in the parish. Seven thatched properties remain and there are a number which incorporate cob.\n"^^xsd:string .

He was helped by the Vicar, the Reverend Robert Crowther and the schoolmaster, Mr John R Pridmore.\nThese three influential men believed firmly in the value of education and the opening of the school placed Spratton ahead of its neighbours in offering education to the children of everyone.\nThe early curriculum consisted of general subjects as well as \u201ca systematic instruction in the Christian religion\u201d. There were two teachers: a mistress for the infants (some as young as two years) and a schoolmaster for the rest of the school.\u00a0 In 1847 the school was housed in a thatched barn with no heating and lighting and it deteriorated so much that by 1910 the building was more or less condemned. The Vicar, the Reverend George Raw, appealed to the village to help raise the \u00a3820 needed to repair and refurbish the building \u2013 a large sum for a small rural community to find.\u00a0 However, with the help of both rich and poor villagers, this was done and the newly renovated school building was opened in 1911.\nThe school log books survive and tell the story of successive schoolmasters struggling to keep up attendance figures in this farming community when children were needed to work with their parents on the land; when scarlet fever, diphtheria and whooping cough ran riot through the village and when epidemics of influenza, mumps and measles kept the children away from school.\nThe dedication of schoolmasters such as Mr Harry Smith (1889-1924) and Mr George Shaw (1924-1950) not only improved the standard of the buildings, but also encouraged good discipline and higher standards of teaching and learning. During the Second World War many evacuee children arrived from London. Mr Shaw and his staff devised a system whereby Spratton children were educated in the morning and the evacuees had their lessons in the afternoons. By the end of the war 315 evacuee children had passed through Spratton school.\nToday the school is a thriving Church of England Voluntary Controlled primary school with academic standards well above the national average and an OFSTED rating of \u2018Good\u2019.\nThe Dame School\nFor several years, up to 1872, a small Dame\u2019s school was also providing elementary education. This was run by one of the village women in her own home but it is not known exactly where it was housed. It was closed after the 1870 education Act as it was not of the required standard and the pupils were assimilated into the Church of England Primary School, whose then schoolmaster commented that \u201cThey were all pretty tolerable dunces and not much used to any discipline\u201d.\nSpratton Hall Preparatory School\nSpratton Hall was built by Francis Beynon, mainly of Kingsthorpe limestone. It has a date on the rainwater leads of 1773 but was probably built in 1760 on the site of an earlier farmhouse.\u00a0 It is a Grade II listed building.\u00a0\nIt was sold in 1818 and then had a number of owners including Captain Mildmay Clerk and his wife Georgiana and Captain Theophilus Gist and his wife Annie and Lord William and Lady Caroline Erskine in 1890 (see First World War men).\nIn 1951 it was purchased by Kenneth and Joan Hunter and turned into a boarding school for 20 boys.\u00a0 A Charitable Trust was established in 1972 with a Board of Governors and in 1975 the Hunters retired.\u00a0 The school became co-educational and then in 1987 it became a day school.\u00a0 Other Headteachers followed and it is now a popular school catering for 400 children aged 4-13.\u00a0 It is a member of the Independent Schools Council and their last inspection report (2010) states that teaching is good overall and that pupils make good progress.\n"^^xsd:string .

The latter was the first husband of Katherine de Roet, mother of the Beauforts by John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster, and subsequently the Duke\u2019s third wife.\nSir John Swinford died on the Feast of St. Stephen (26th December) 1371. His fine memorial is the intricately carved alabaster tomb now in the chancel of St. Andrew\u2019s Church. That he was a follower of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, as evidenced by an SS decoration on the chain around his neck on the memorial, with whom he is belived to have fought together with the Black Prince in the French wars. The whole tomb was originally brightly coloured with traces of paint still to be seen around the coat of arms. There is a charming lion at his feet.\nHe married Joan, daughter of Sir Thomas Arden in 1366 and, through her inherited part of the manor of Spratton. Their daughter Elizabeth was married at the age of 13 to William de Addebury and secondly to Roger Chambers. Their descendants continued to hold the manor for many generations.\n"^^xsd:string .

More recently other groups and societies have been formed for social or charitable purposes:\nThe Women's Institute\nThe Spratton Branch of the Women\u2019s Institute was formed in 1923 under the Chairmanship of Lady Erskine of Spratton Hall. Fund raising activities enabled a hall to be built by 1928 and by the 1950s there were over 50 members. The hall was refurbished thanks to a generous donation and became the Village Hall in 2005.\nScouts, Guides, Cubs, Beavers & Brownies\nA Scout troop was first founded in 1940 but soon closed. They were restarted by leaders in 1976 and 1985. A Girl Guide company was set up in 1936 but closed in 1939 when the leader volunteered as a FANY. It too was later restarted. A Cub pack was established in 1975, Beavers in 1995 and a Brownie pack organised since the 1950\u2019s. In 1996 the old Catholic Church building in Yew Tree Lane was purchased and today is used by all these groups.\n\"The Rec\"\nThe Spratton Recreation Field Charity was set up in 1951 and purchased a 7.4 acre field on Smith Street. In 1977 a Sports and Social Club building was erected and has been in very active use ever since. Football, cricket, tennis and other activities have all taken place there . There is a small children's playground and a skateboard park opened in 2004.\nTown & Charity Land\nThe Charity Commission of 1676 recorded gifts from residents to help the community and those less fortunate than themselves. The money was used to purchase land, initially for allotments. Today the charity administers allotments and some grazing land and makes grants towards the fabric of the Church, those in need, student support for further education and other local projects or societies.\n.....and Others\nMany other community activities are or have been pursued, including the Football Club, Cricket, a Brass Band, a Youth Club, a Reading Room, a\u00a0 volunteer Fire Brigade, a Garden Club and the Spratton Local History Society. They are all described in our book \"Spratton, a Village History\"\n"^^xsd:string .

(b.1778)\nJohn Freeman enlisted in 1798 and served in the Royal Horse Guards at Waterloo in Drake\u2019s Troop. From a starting strength of around 50 men, 10 were killed and many more wounded.\u00a0 Freeman was discharged in 1821 aged 43.\u00a0 He married Jane Pretty in Spratton on 12th September 1830.\u00a0 The 1841 census lists him as living in Spratton, a shoemaker.\u00a0 The 1851 census gives his age as 72 and describes him as \u201cChelsea Pensioner Royal Horse Guards blue private 1s per day\u201d.\u00a0 He died in 1853.\u00a0 (From Waterloo Men of Northamptonshire by Martin Aaron 2015)\n"^^xsd:string .
